Shortcode for reading a Reddit subreddit with comments

== Description ==

This plugin gives you a WordPress interface to Reddit's API. By simply putting in a shortcode on a page in WP,
that page gives you access to links, votes, usernames, and comments from a selected subreddit. The access is
read-only with no posting of comments or voting, which is where the name of the plugin comes from.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to `wp-content/plugins`
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu
3. (Optional) Change settings for overview and comment limits (maximal amount of entries to fetch, or 0 for the default value)
4. Add the shortcode `[reddit-lurker subreddit="name"]` to a page
